                    <span class="biggest-font">In October 2019, Peter and Marina got their wedding photos back. Peter
                        said
                        he and his wife could not
                        believe what they were seeing.</span></br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“Is that REALLY us? Do we look like that for real?”</span>
                    Peter said as he looked through his wedding photos.</br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“The mirror REALLY does play tricks on your mind. It
                        justifies
                        what you see. It makes things seem far
                        better than what they are. I read somewhere the mirror is how you see yourself. And photos are
                        how
                        the
                        world sees you”.</span></br></br>

                    Peter and Marina KNEW it was time for a change. They both wanted to improve their health, manage
                    their
                    weight better and achieve healthy weight loss.</br></br>

                    The only issue?</br></br>

                    They had already tried everything and they just could not seem to find what worked.</br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“When it comes to losing weight- we had tried everything.
                        Literally everything, "</span> Marina said.</br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“Calorie counting. Keto. Paleo. Fasting. Low Carb. High
                        intensity training. Carnivore. Basically any
                        diet or exercise program you can think of- we had tried them all”</span> said Peter.</br></br>

                    <img src="buffer2.jpg" alt="placeholder">

                    Peter and Marina were so lost in the sea of information that they had practically given
                    up.</br></br>

                    Until something motivated them to try to get in shape again.</br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“My best friend came over and asked me to be his best man
                        at
                        his upcoming wedding. And my wife was asked
                        to be the Maid of honour. We have been best friends with this couple since high school. We were
                        so
                        honoured!</br></br>

                        But…We also knew we wanted to get in shape.</br></br>

                        My best friend's wedding was in 6 months time so we talked for DAYS about what approach to take”
                    </span> said
                    Peter.</br></br>

                    Marina spent days and countless hours on the internet looking for a solution. She wanted to make
                    sure
                    her and her husband got to the wedding looking their best.</br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“What really demotivated me was finding the same
                        information
                        regurgitated over and over again. And
                        everything that I found online was something we had already tried.</br></br>

                        We almost gave up until…” </span></br></br>

                    Then the big breakthrough happened.</br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“I was scrolling through social media before bed and I saw
                        this guy named Coach Connor.</span></br></br>

                    <img src="buffer3.jpg" alt="placeholder">

                    <span class="italicized bold">He was talking about things like:</br>

                        <span style="font-size: 24px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;• </span>Training your body to eat as much food as
                        possible.</br>
                        <span style="font-size: 24px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;• </span>How to increase your metabolic rate with one
                        simple step</br>
                        <span style="font-size: 24px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;• </span>Eating the right superfoods for optimal
                        results</br></br>

                        And so much more.</br></br>

                        Everything he said made so much sense and was completely different from what we had
                        tried.</br></br>

                        So we purchased the program for literally the price of a cup of coffee!</br></br>

                        And it TRULY changed our life”</span></br></br>

                        <img src="buffer4.jpg" alt="placeholder">

                    Marina said her and her husband saw the best results of their life using the program known as the
                    DB90
                    Program.</br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“Honestly- Never in a million years did I think I could
                        look
                        how I look now. This is honestly the
                        greatest program I have ever used. And the best part is once you get in shape using this
                        program-
                        keeping everything off is a breeze!”</span></br></br>

                    Here are the 3 steps that helped Peter and Marina transform:</br></br>

                    1- Eat Meals you LOVE every single day</br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“The fact that I was able to enjoy myself as much as I did
                        on
                        my weight loss journey is a blessing.</br></br>

                        I think when you immediately have to cut out all your favourite foods- your willpower is
                        absolutely
                        zapped”</span> said Marina.</br></br>

                    The couple enjoyed plenty of tasty meals on their journey:</br></br>

                    2- Find The SuperFood that resonates with your body and metabolism</br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“Every single human body is different. And what works for
                        one
                        person may not work for another.</br></br>

                        That is why you have to follow the protocol in the program to find what works for you”</span>
                    said
                    Peter.</br></br>

                    The couple said they had to experiment to see which SuperFoods the program listed worked for
                    them.</br></br>

                    It turns out that a fresh Orange every single day is exactly what Marina’s body needed to jump start
                    her
                    metabolism.</br></br>

                    But Peter on the other hand- he required Cranberry Juice.</br></br>

                    <span class="italicized bold">“Once you find what works for you- you are going to love
                        the
                        progress you see”-</span> said Marina.</br></br>

                    3- Get the Complete DB90 Program for the price of a bottle of water</br></br>
