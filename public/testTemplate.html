                    class="color-yellow bigger-font bold">SHORTCUT</span></h1>
            <p>
                Before creating DB90- I did Keto, Paleo, Carnivore, Fasting, Calorie Counting, Low Carb, Low-Fat and
                every other diet you can think of. </br></br>

                Either they did not work at all OR they worked for a short period of time until my body hit a plateau.
                </br></br>

                So I decided to find a better way. </br></br>

                After a one in a million chance encounter with one of the smartest people I have ever met in my life, I
                was finally able to find something that TRULY worked. </br></br>

                Something that worked better for me than all of the other methods combined. </br></br>

                While at the same time being so easy and effortless- it felt like cheating. </br></br>

                I was able to live an incredible life with no restrictions and enjoy every day with my family.
                </br></br>

                Here is a snapshot of how it works: </br></br>
            </p>

            <img src="snapshop.png" alt="placeholder"></br></br>

            <h1>HERE IS WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU</h1>
            <p>
                Every "Diet" ever created has one thing in common. </br></br>

                It RESTRICTS You. It takes away all the food you love and forces you to have food you despise for months
                on end to see meaningless results. </br></br>

                It takes away the joy of life. </br></br>

                That's why the DB90 Program is NOT a diet. </br></br>

                It is a SYSTEM that actually shows you how to properly NOURISH your body and give it what it's asking
                for- INSTEAD of taking away its nutrients and causing it to work less effectively. </br></br>

                The DB90 Program was created to show people the NEW way of making weight loss as close to effortless as
                humanly possible. </br></br>

                From: The desk of Coach Shane Morris</br>
                Re: The easiest fat loss method ever</br></br>


                Dear Friend, </br></br>


                I have been where you are now…Believe Me. </br></br>

                This was me not long ago. </br></br>

                An overweight Personal Trainer who had struggled with his weight for over 12 years. </br></br>

                As you can imagine- I also struggled getting clients. </br></br>

                Because they could see I couldn't help them because I could not even help myself. </br></br>


                But after all those years struggling…I discovered something. </br></br>

                I call it the "Fat Loss Sweet Spot". </br></br>

                And once you discover it…</br></br>

                You will uncover the power of EFFORTLESS Fat Loss </br></br>

                The power to lose fat on autopilot WITHOUT even trying </br></br>

                Once I discovered this breakthrough…</br></br>

                I made more progress in under 3 months than I had in the last 15 years. </br></br>

                <span style="color: red;">INSERT COACH SHANE BEFORE AND AFTERS</span></br></br>

                Don't just take it from me. </br></br>

                Here is undeniable proof:</br></br>

                <span style="color: red;">INSERT BEFORE + AFTERS/ Screenshots</span></br></br>

                You are probably thinking…</br></br>

                HOW? </br></br>

                I was lost, stuck and confused. Then THIS man changed everything for me. </br></br>

                He saw me struggling for months and one day he just came up to me and asked me a simple
                question…</br></br>

                “Do you think what you are doing is working?”</br></br>

                He then explained to me what was TRULY going on with my body and why billions of people around the world
                are struggling with their weight.

            <div class="description-limit-testimonial center-text">
                <p style="color: black;" class="bold">
                    Most of us suffer from a condition known as Catabolic Imbalance </br></br>

                    The worst part? </br></br>

                    WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT! </br>
                    You see…</br></br>

                    The world has changed DRASTICALLY over the last 100 years. </br></br>

                    The human population has grown to almost 8 BILLION people. </br></br>

                    And all of these people need to be fed</br></br>

                    So what was the solution Governments and Corporations came up with in order to FEED these people?
                    </br></br>

                    Chemicals Infusion into our food supply. </br></br>

                    They added chemicals to our entire food supply that made food grow faster, quicker and more
                    resilient. </br></br>

                    Chemicals were added to fruits and vegetables that made them grow in the harshest conditions like
                    snow or extreme heat. </br></br>

                    Even most organic foods contain chemicals (but in lower doses so they can fly under the radar).
                    </br></br>

                    The end result is we are able to have much cheaper food supplies…</br></br>

                    However- this comes at a cost. </br></br>

                    It seems all of these chemicals are impacting our fat loss hormones by blocking the signals our
                    brain is able to send to our body. </br></br>

                    These signals are so our body can produce fat burning hormones like Leptin and Peptide YY.
                    </br></br>

                    These hormones help flush out excess fat and supercharge your metabolism. </br></br>

                    Without these hormones in your body…</br></br>

                    You give this imposter power over you and become your FAKE SELF </br></br>

                    ❌ Why do you spend money on Ozempic, Weight Loss Supplements and other weight loss gimmick products?
                    These products do NOT address the ROOT CAUSE of weight gain </br></br>

                    ❌Why are you cutting carbs? Your body needs them to fuel your brain and your hormones. </br></br>

                    ❌Why do you drop calories drastically? If you are not feeding your body the fuel it needs- it will
                    crash and hit a plateau </br></br>

                    ❌Why do eat food you hate? Every meal that you hate STEALS your willpower and sets you up to fail
                    </br></br>

                    ❌Why do you do super intense or long exercise sessions? These put your body in energy saving mode
                    and PREVENT fat loss </br></br>

                    ❌ Why do you lose weight and then your progress suddenly stops? THIS is your body fighting against
                    you and this leads to weight gain shortly after and should be avoided at all costs </br></br>

                    ❌ Why do you sacrifice eating good food with your family during special occasions and good times?

                    ✅ They do SUPER EASY & SUPER LOW IMPACT movements that torch fat </br></br>

                    ✅ They lose fat in a permanent manner by SPEEDING UP the metabolism while losing weight instead of

                <p>The DB90 Program is a body transformation system designed to help you lose weight and uncover your
                    dream body in just 90 days. It works by activating your body's "fat loss sweet spot" through a
                    3-phase approach focused on optimizing your metabolism without giving up your favorite foods or
                    needing a gym membership.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How does the DB90 Program work?</h3>
                <p>The program has 3 phases: Testing Phase, Metabolism Boost Phase, and Maximum Fat Loss Phase.

                    The Testing Phase finds your fat loss sweet spot by having you eat your favorite foods.
                    The Metabolism Boost Phase increases your metabolism so you can eat more while losing weight.
                    The Maximum Fat Loss Phase activates peak fat burning so you lose weight rapidly while enjoying your
                    favorite meals.</p>

                <p>
                    DB90 is not a restrictive diet. It does not cut carbs or calories. There are no long, intense
                    workouts. Instead, the DB90 program works with your body by giving it the exact foods and movements
                    it needs to switch into fat burning mode. You get to eat foods you love in the right amounts to
                    boost your metabolism.
